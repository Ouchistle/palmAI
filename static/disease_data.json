    "category": "Disease",
    "description": "Pathogens such as Fusarium, Phytophthora, or Pseudomonas can infect date palm leaves, leading to spotting, necrosis, wilting, and collapse if left untreated. These are commonly worsened by high humidity, poor sanitation, and plant stress.",
    "symptoms": [
      "Brown or black lesions on fronds",
      "Streaks or blight along midribs or leaflets",
      "Wilting or collapse of fronds",

      "Yellowing or browning of fronds",
      "Visible pests or honeydew on leaves",
      "Frond drop or deformation",

    "causes": [
      "Infestation by sap-sucking or boring insects",
      "Warm, dry weather promoting pest activity",
      "Lack of biological or chemical control",
